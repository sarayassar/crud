This project will allow you to manage a collection of books. The system will use a database (like MySQL) to store the information for each book.

Here's how you can apply the four CRUD operations to this project:

C - Create (Add a New Book): You'll create a page or a form that allows you to input the details of a new book, such as its title, author, and publication year. When you submit the form, your PHP code will add this book to the database.

R - Read (View the Book List): The main page of your application will display a list of all the books currently in the database. Your PHP script will retrieve all the data and show it in a well-organized table or a simple list.

U - Update (Edit a Book's Details): Next to each book in the list, you can add an "Edit" button. Clicking it would take you to a form pre-filled with the book's current information. You can then change the title or author, and the changes will be saved to the database.

D - Delete (Remove a Book): Also next to each book, you can add a "Delete" button. When you click it, your PHP code will remove that book's data from the database. It's a good practice to add a confirmation message before deleting to prevent mistakes.

This project idea covers all the CRUD requirements and gives you a clear roadmap to start building.
